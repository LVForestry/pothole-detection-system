   Arduino Giga R1 Central Controller
   Pothole Detection System
   ================================
   Initializing sensor input pins...
   ...
   System initialized successfully
   ```

## First Test

### Test 1: WiFi Access Point

1. On your phone/laptop, scan for WiFi networks
2. Look for "Pothole-Detection-AP"
3. Connect (no password required)

### Test 2: Web Dashboard

1. While connected to the AP, open a browser
2. Go to: `http://192.168.4.1/`
3. You should see the dashboard with 16 sensors

### Test 3: Pin Detection

1. Connect a jumper wire to pin 23 (first sensor)
2. Touch the other end to 5V pin
3. Check Serial Monitor for "POTHOLE DETECTED!" message
4. Check dashboard - sensor R1 should show "ALERT - HIGH"

## What's Next?

### Connect Sensor Nodes

Once you have sensor nodes ready:

1. Wire each sensor node's output pin to the corresponding Giga R1 input pin
2. Power on the sensor nodes
3. Watch the dashboard for real-time detections

### Configure Sensors

To calibrate a sensor:

1. Open the dashboard
2. Click "Configure" on any sensor
3. Enter zero reference (normal distance in cm)
4. Enter threshold (detection depth in cm, e.g., 5)
5. Click OK

### Monitor System

Keep the Serial Monitor open to see:
- System status messages
- Real-time detection events
- BLE connection logs
- Web server activity

## Common First-Time Issues

### "Board not found"
**Solution**: Install Arduino Mbed OS Giga Boards package (Step 2)

### "Library not found"
**Solution**: Install ArduinoBLE library (Step 3)

### "Upload failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check USB connection
- Try a different USB port
- Press reset button on Giga R1 twice quickly (enters bootloader)

### "WiFi AP not visible"
**Solution**: 
- Wait 30 seconds after upload
- Press reset button on Giga R1
- Check Serial Monitor for error messages

### "Dashboard not loading"
**Solution**:
- Verify you're connected to "Pothole-Detection-AP"
- Try http://192.168.4.1/ (not https)
- Clear browser cache

## Daily Operation

### Starting Up
1. Power on the Giga R1
2. Wait 10-15 seconds for initialization
3. WiFi AP will be available
4. Dashboard is accessible

### Monitoring
- Keep Serial Monitor open for real-time logs
- Access dashboard from any device on the WiFi
- Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

### Shutting Down
- Simply disconnect power
- No special shutdown procedure required
- Settings are preserved (stored on sensor nodes)

## Tips for Success

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Keep the Serial Monitor open during testing
- Test each pin individually before connecting all sensors
- Use appropriate wire gauge for all connections
- Document your sensor-to-pin mappings
- Make regular backups of your configuration

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Connect pins to voltages higher than 5V
- Block the WiFi antenna area
- Expose electronics to moisture
- Forget to ground all devices to common ground
- Upload firmware while sensors are actively triggering

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Serial Monitor** - Most errors are reported here
2. **Review Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Detailed feature documentation
   - `INSTALLATION.md` - Complete installation guide
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design details
3. **Verify Connections** - Double-check all wiring

   - For each sensor:
     - Click "Poll Sensor" to get current distance
     - Click "Configure"
     - Set zero reference to current distance
     - Set threshold to 5 cm (adjustable)

3. **Operation Phase** (continuous)
   - System automatically monitors all sensors
   - Dashboard shows real-time status
   - Serial Monitor logs all events
   - No user interaction required

4. **Maintenance Phase** (as needed)
   - Check dashboard for sensor health
   - Recalibrate if needed
   - Review event logs via Serial Monitor
