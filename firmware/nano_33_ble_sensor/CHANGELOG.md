- **Robust Communication**: I2C error handling and recovery
- **User-friendly Setup**: Pre-configured examples for all sensors

### Technical Details
- Firmware size: ~8.3KB
- RAM usage: Minimal (well within Nano 33 BLE limits)
- Flash storage: 5 bytes per configuration
- I2C speed: 400kHz (Fast Mode)
- BLE update rate: 10Hz (matches measurement rate)
- Detection latency: <100ms
- Output signal duration: 2000ms Â±50ms

### Hardware Support
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE (nRF52840)
- TFLuna LIDAR sensor (I2C mode)
- Compatible with Arduino Giga R1 controller

### Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE 1.8.13+ or Arduino IDE 2.x
- Arduino Mbed OS Nano Boards package
- ArduinoBLE library v1.3.0+
- FlashStorage library v1.0.0+

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates via BLE
- Data logging with timestamps
- Enhanced filtering for noise reduction
- Low-power sleep modes
- Diagnostic LED indicators
- Multi-threshold detection zones
- Temperature compensation
- Event buffering for missed BLE connections

### Known Limitations
- BLE range limited to ~10m line-of-sight
- I2C cable length should be <30cm for reliability
- No battery operation mode (requires constant 5V)
- Configuration limited to 2 parameters (zero ref, threshold)
- No built-in diagnostics for TFLuna sensor health

### Future Improvements
- Add CRC checking for flash storage
- Implement watchdog timer for fault recovery
- Add multiple detection zones with different thresholds
- Support for multiple LIDAR sensors per node
- Enhanced BLE security (pairing/bonding)
- UART mode support for TFLuna (as alternative to I2C)
- Configurable measurement rate
- Configurable output signal duration
