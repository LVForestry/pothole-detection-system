# Security Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines security considerations for the Pothole Detection System firmware. As this is an embedded IoT system, security should be carefully evaluated based on your deployment environment and requirements.

## Current Security Posture

### Implemented Security Features

✅ **Local Network Isolation**
- System operates on isolated WiFi Access Point
- No direct internet connectivity by default
- Physical proximity required for access

✅ **Limited Attack Surface**
- Simple HTTP protocol (no complex frameworks)
- Minimal external dependencies
- Read-only file system (code in flash)

✅ **Input Validation**
- Sensor index bounds checking
- JSON parsing with basic validation
- BLE timeout mechanisms

### Known Security Limitations

⚠️ **No Authentication**
- Web dashboard has no login
- API endpoints are open access
- Anyone on WiFi can control system

⚠️ **No Encryption**
- HTTP traffic is unencrypted
- WiFi AP can be open (no password)
- BLE communication is not encrypted at application level

⚠️ **No Authorization**
- All API endpoints equally accessible
- No role-based access control
- Configuration changes not restricted

⚠️ **Limited Input Validation**
- Minimal sanitization of inputs
- No rate limiting on requests
- No CSRF protection

⚠️ **No Audit Logging**
- Configuration changes not logged
- No access tracking
- Limited forensics capability

## Security Risks by Component

### WiFi Access Point

**Risks**:
- Open network allows unauthorized access
- No encryption of wireless traffic
- Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks
- WiFi password stored in plaintext in code

**Mitigations**:
- Use WPA2 password (configure in config.h)
- Deploy in controlled physical environment
- Monitor for unauthorized devices
- Change default SSID to avoid fingerprinting

**Recommendations**:
```cpp
// In config.h, set a strong password:
#define WIFI_AP_PASSWORD  "YourStrongPassword123!"
```

### Web Dashboard

**Risks**:
- No authentication required
- HTTP allows traffic interception
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) potential
- No CSRF protection
- Session hijacking possible

**Mitigations**:
- Limit WiFi range to minimum needed
- Use firewall rules if possible
- Physical security of access point
- Regular monitoring of connected devices

**Recommendations**:
- Add basic authentication (future enhancement)
- Implement HTTPS (requires certificates)
- Add CSRF tokens
- Sanitize all displayed data

### HTTP API

**Risks**:
- No authentication on endpoints
- No rate limiting
- JSON injection possible
- Command injection via parameters
- DoS through repeated requests

**Mitigations**:
- Input validation on sensor indices
- Bounded BLE operation timeouts
- Simple JSON parsing (less vulnerable)
- Limited buffer sizes

**Recommendations**:
- Implement API keys
- Add rate limiting
- Validate all JSON inputs thoroughly
- Add request throttling

### BLE Communication

**Risks**:
- BLE scanning exposes device presence
- No application-level encryption
- Spoofed sensor nodes possible
- Replay attacks possible
- Man-in-the-middle on BLE

**Mitigations**:
- BLE has built-in pairing (not implemented)
- Device name matching provides basic validation
- Limited BLE range reduces exposure
- Timeout prevents infinite scanning

**Recommendations**:
- Implement BLE pairing
- Add authentication to characteristics
- Use BLE encryption features
- Verify device certificates/signatures

### Serial Interface

**Risks**:
- Sensitive data logged to serial
- Physical access allows monitoring
- Logs may contain configuration data

**Mitigations**:
- Serial requires physical access
- Can disable logging in config.h
- No critical secrets logged

**Recommendations**:
- Disable verbose logging in production
- Secure physical access to device
- Review logs for sensitive data

## Threat Model

### Low-Threat Scenarios

**Private Property, Controlled Access**
- System deployed on private road
- Physical access controlled
- Small, trusted user base
- WiFi range limited to property

**Risk Level**: LOW
**Current Security**: Adequate

### Medium-Threat Scenarios

**Public Infrastructure, Local Network**
- System on public road
- WiFi accessible from public areas
- Multiple authorized users
- Some data sensitivity

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Recommendations**:
- Add WPA2 password
- Implement basic authentication
- Add access logging
- Regular security audits

### High-Threat Scenarios

**Critical Infrastructure, Internet Connected**
- System controlling important infrastructure
- Internet connectivity added
- High availability requirement
- Regulatory compliance needed

**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Recommendations**:
- Implement full authentication/authorization
- Add HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Deploy intrusion detection
- Regular security testing
- Compliance certifications

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate array indices
   - Check string lengths
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Validate JSON structure

2. **Buffer Management**
   - Use bounded buffers
   - Avoid buffer overflows
   - Check array bounds
   - Use safe string functions

- Prototype/development environments
- Closed, private networks
- Low-security requirements
- Educational purposes

### Production Deployment

For production use, especially in public or sensitive environments:
- Implement recommended security enhancements
- Conduct thorough security assessment
- Follow security best practices
- Regular security monitoring
- Incident response planning

### Recommendation

**Evaluate your threat model and implement appropriate security measures before production deployment.**

The current implementation provides a foundation for a secure system but requires additional hardening for high-security or public-facing deployments.
